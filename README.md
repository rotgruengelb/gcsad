## asset
An asset is a file/code-snippet (or something similar) that is not useful on its own but is needed/used for example by a program.
Examples:
- a Logo (Image File) is not useful on its own, but is useful when used as an Icon in an app. (note that if the image file is for example a screenshot of a program flow, it is a resource because it can be used by itself to for example learn about an application.)
- an HTML SVG path code-snippet can't be used on its own, but is useful when used in a website.
